Portfolio 3
Web application to aid students to calculate their grades and let them know how hard they would need to work in order 
to achieve a certain grade in the class. Since some students really struggle to calculate their grades and sometimes 
it can be a really hard task therefore this app would really help such students.
To make the app more fun and useful for students we worked on implementing features like, creating and using flash-cards, 
including chat functionality, canvas sharing for students to interact with other students or faculty to discuss study 
related issues etc.
